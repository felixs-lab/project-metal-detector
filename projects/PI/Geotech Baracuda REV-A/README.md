Geotech Baracuda - REV-A - Project Details
09-16-2016, 10:41 PM
Here you will find complete details of the new Geotech Baracuda - REV-A.

As with previous projects, I cannot guarantee the Build Document is totally error-free, so please provide feedback if you find something wrong. As you will no doubt be aware, it's always difficult to check your own work.

The Geotech Baracuda is based on the original Baracuda from Anchor Electronics. The design was first published by Alexismex in 2011 and (although people have reported some success) there have been a number of underlying problems with many of the builds, particularly when using a supply voltage that is too high. There are also several versions of the Baracuda schematic floating around, with each of them containing subtle differences, and many of these have discrepancies between the schematic and the layout. Following a number of Geotech members experiencing issues with the original design, it was decided to take a closer look and try to isolate the source (or sources) of these problems. All changes made are described in the attached Build Document. In fact, it is also possible for anyone with a previous Baracuda PCB to carry out cut-and-strap surgery on the board to bring it up to the same standard. I've already done it, so I know it's possible.

Updates and Corrections

2016-09-20: C20 was incorrectly shown as 100pF. Changed to 100nF. Also updated number of 100nF capacitors in the Parts List from 8 to 9.
2016-12-07: Warning: The lower pin of P2 is unconnected on the PCB. This will be corrected in the next revision.
2020-08-24: Build Document updated to match kit components, and also to correct an error concerning the adjustment of R14 (minimum sample delay).
2021-01-12: Build document below shows Q1 as IRF9940 instead of IRF9640 in the Component Parts List on page 9.

The latest Build Document is Ref. 20200822-A (shown in the footer on each page). If you have a copy with a different number, then delete it and download the current version. Note: There were 1887 views of the Build Document prior to the new version being uploaded.
